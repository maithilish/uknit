# uKnit

uKnit is a unit test generator with Mockito mocks. It reduces the typing by more than 80 to 90%, and the developer just has to step in and fine-tune the final test.

## Features

uKnit is quite powerful and generates tests for complex Java classes. Some of the highlights are

 - Easy to install and use; tested in Eclipse and Idea IDE.
 - Defines, initializes the variables, constructs when, then, and verify statements.
 - Generates separate test for each and every control flow path with test coverage greater than 90%.
 - Variable names are closely tied to source code for easy comparison between source and test code.
 - Use of a mock or real object for a type is user-defined.
 - Handles nested method calls such as private or super methods.
 - Supports lambda and method reference constructs.
